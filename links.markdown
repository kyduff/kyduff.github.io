Some articles and other media that I find interesting.

* In [The Bitter Lesson][the_bitter_lesson], Richard Sutton describes a difficult pill every aspiring deep-learning-programmer should swallow before trying to do something great.
* [The Future of Mathematics?][buzz_future] Kevin Buzzard talks about formalizing all of mathematics.
* [As We May Think][as_we_may_think]: the internet has gotten us closer to Vannevar Bush's vision, but there's still more to go.
* [The Use of Knowledge in Society][use_of_knowledge]: macro planning in worlds of fractured knowledge.
