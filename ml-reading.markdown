title: ML Reading Group

In October 2021 I started a reading group among my cohort in the MSc in Advanced Computer Science at Oxford University. We read papers that highlight important activity in the field of Machine Learning, going for breadth over depth. The point is to develop a spanning view of the field so that we might have good ideas on how to change it.

## List

#### 29 October 2021
* [_Rubin and Berant 2021_: **SmBoP: Semi-autoregressive Bottom-up Semantic Parsing**][SmBoP] presented by Kyle Duffy
* [_Vaswani et. al. 2017_: **Attention Is All You Need**][transformers] presented by Oliver Rausch

#### 5 November 2021
* [_Raffel et. al. 2019_: **Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer**][T5] (usually referred to as "T5") presented by Kyle Duffy
