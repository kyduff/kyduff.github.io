I build products that make it easier to get more from computers.

I think the best way to do that is to make computer interfaces more natural with the help of machine learning.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Oxford][oxcs], and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Notre Dame][ndmath].

Outside of [NLP][nlp], I like to study [psychological biases][influence], [the history of businesses][teledyne], and [stories of remarkable people][zemurray].
