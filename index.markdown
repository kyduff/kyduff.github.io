I build products that make it easier to get more from computers.

I think the best way to do that is to make computer interfaces more natural with the help of machine learning.

Right now, I'm doing that by building language models at [Cohere][cohere].

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Oxford][oxcs] and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Notre Dame][ndmath].
