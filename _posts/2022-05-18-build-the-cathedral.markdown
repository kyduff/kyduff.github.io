1. If I build a basic experimental environment, it will help me experiment with ideas more rapidly.
2. Rapid experimentation leads to rapid feedback.
3. Rapid feedback leads to higher quality ideas given appropriate reception and response.
4. Higher quality ideas lead to more effective semantic parsers.
5. More effective semantic parsers leads to more precise control over computing machines.
6. More precise control over computer machines leads to (1) better expression of human creativity and (2) reduced X-risk of robots taking over the world.
7. I like human creativity and I don't want robots to take over the world, therefore I build a basic experimental environment.
